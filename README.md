## Notes

One of the challenges I faced was optimizing the code to avoid repetition while maintaining readability. Initially, each card component was hardcoded, making the code lengthy and difficult to manage. To simplify it, I used an array to store salon data and implemented the .map() function to dynamically generate the cards. This reduced redundancy and improved scalability. Additionally, refining the CSS to ensure a consistent and responsive layout required adjustments, but it ultimately made the styling more efficient and maintainable.
